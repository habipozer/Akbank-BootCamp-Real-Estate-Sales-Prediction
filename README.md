# Real Estate Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project develops a comprehensive machine learning solution for real estate price prediction using supervised learning techniques. The goal is to create an accurate predictive model that can estimate property prices based on various features including assessed values, location, property types, and economic periods.

## Problem Statement

Real estate price prediction is a critical challenge in the property market. This project addresses the need for accurate, data-driven property valuation by leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict prices based on historical data and property characteristics.

## Dataset Information

- **Source**: Real Estate Dataset
- **Features**: 
  - Assessed Value (Log transformed)
  - Location (Town encoding)
  - Property Types
  - Temporal features (Year, Month)
  - Economic periods (Pre_Boom, Economic_Crisis, Post_Crisis, COVID_Era)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Key Findings

- **Price Distribution**: Log-normal distribution requiring logarithmic transformation
- **Temporal Trends**: Clear economic period impacts on property prices
- **Location Impact**: Significant variation across different towns
- **Property Types**: Single-family homes dominate the dataset
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Monthly variations in property transactions

### Visualizations

- Price distribution histograms
- Correlation heatmaps
- Time series analysis
- Geographic price variations
- Feature importance plots

## Data Preprocessing

### Applied Techniques

1. **Missing Value Treatment**: Handled missing data through imputation
2. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - Log transformation of assessed values
   - Economic period categorization
   - Town encoding
3. **Categorical Encoding**: One-hot encoding for property types
4. **Feature Scaling**: Normalization for numerical features
5. **Train-Test Split**: 80-20 split for model validation

  -  reg_lambda   
  -  gamma              
  -  min_child_weight
- **Validation**: 3-fold cross-validation

## Model Performance

### Final Model Metrics

- **Algorithm**: XGBoost Regressor
- **R² Score**: 0.7133
- **RMSE**: 0.4692
- **MAE**: 0.2823

### Feature Importance (SHAP Analysis)

1. **Assessed_Value_Log** (0.46) - Primary price indicator
2. **Post_Crisis** (0.11) - Economic period impact
3. **Town_Encoded** (0.11) - Location significance
4. **Year** (0.09) - Temporal trend
5. **Month_Numerical** (0.03) - Seasonal effect
